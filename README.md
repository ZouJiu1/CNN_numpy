# cnn in numpy 
## train
I write a cnn network in numpy fully, including forward and backpropagation.<br><br>
In training, it use cpu and slowly, so I write three model with different size, the network is modified by alexnet<br><br>
Training it with MNIST dataset, **itâ€™s precision can > 90%**, it's training now<br><br>
this codes provide functions to save model and restore model to train<br><br>
you can find those models in model dir<br><br>
Train with command<br><br>
```
python train_alexnet_mnist.py
```
